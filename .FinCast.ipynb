    "# Budgetting App\n",
    "This  is a budgetting app made to forecast salary after taxes, expenses, savings, and investments.\n",
    "I intend to use this project primarily to apply introductory financial concepts as I am trying to understand my personal finances and to practise data analysis and visualisation in Python. In the future this project could evolve into a personal finance forecasting app to help folks understanding their finances and planning for their financial goals, including mortgage payment, further education, savings, portfolio management, choosing between jobs, cities and you name it!"
